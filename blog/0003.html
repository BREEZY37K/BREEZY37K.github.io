        <h2>ode to an oil change</h2>
        <h3>december 17, 2024 - 8:13 am</h3>
        
        <p>
            I challenged myself to write something in the time it took to get my oil changed. I was there for about two and a half hours.

            I haven't been awake this early in a while. The morning has a different kind of air than any other time of day. I miss it. It reminds me of the time that I got to spend 
            with my Grandparents over the summer. My Mom would drop me off at their place on her way to work—it was still early enough in the morning to see the dew on the grass. 
            I miss them. It's been a while since they've died, but sometimes that kind of stuff just hits you. I don't know. I'm not really a spiritual guy, but sometimes I think 
            the past tries to speak to us. For me, it's hard to go somewhere I've been before without seeing the memories I made there, good and bad. When I'm in a new place, one 
            without memories, it makes me uneasy because it feels strangely empty. Yet to be filled by the thoughts racing in my head. Like the waiting room of this auto body repair 
            shop. The fake leather chairs, the hum of a nearby vending machine, the faint glow of the television in my periphery. That distinct smell of grime and steel. All things 
            that I've experienced before, I might've even experienced all these things at the same time before, but right now is different. It is its own unique moment in time.

            I don’t know what I’m trying to say.

            I have to go back home for Christmas next week. Home is a difficult place to be sometimes. The drive between home and the rest of my life is always the best part. It's 
            not that I don't like my family or enjoy their company; it's just that I enjoy those moments of silence a little more. There's something so cathartic about being on the 
            road, it just allows me to truly wander. Maybe it's the wind. Every thought you have you can toss out the window into the jet stream and drive away at whatever speed you 
            feel most comfortable. The stretch of I-90 between Cleveland and Rochester has let me throw a lot of stuff out the window. Figuratively, of course. There's a rest stop 
            between Buffalo and the Pennsylvania state line but it's been closed for construction for like two years now. It's one of those rest stops that sits on top of a hill in 
            between both sides of the highway, so you park on the side and walk through a sky bridge to get to the McDonald's or whatever. I wonder, when it's done being renovated, 
            will the rest stop be so unrecognizable that my memories will have disappeared—will they have left for some place else, or will I have forgotten about them?

            There's this game that I play with myself on road trips. It's called, "What Will We See More Of On The Side Of The Road: Dead Deer or Shredded Tires?" The title needs a 
            bit of work. I'll give you a little tip: you will win 99% of the time if you go with tires. It's not a very fun game, but I think we all have these games and tricks we 
            do to keep us from straying too far away from the pavement. It gets lonely out there sometimes. The stereo and its satellite noise are often the only voices in between 
            the farmland and rolling hills. It's hard not to imagine what the people who live out there think about. The interstate troopers, firework store employees, farmhands, 
            and wildlife specialists. Is the highway a thing that connects them to the rest of the country, or is it a nuisance to their everyday? Do they feel burdened by the needs 
            and wants of the outside world? Do they feel the weight of the worries I leave behind on the road? Do my thoughts fill their forests as they also fill the inside of my car? I must imagine that's hard. I hope they know that someone out there cares about them.

            It's hard. I'm really trying to describe to you my present moment. This tension and uncertainty that permeate my skin. I wish I was a better writer. There are few things 
            as satisfying as stringing together the right words that perfectly describe a situation and a feeling. I worry that my writing often doesn't accomplish that—that I 
            don't connect to you. There's this fear that I've wasted your time, as mine has been wasted by others. As I'm surrounded by car ads, brochures, wine magazines, and this 
            131-page word search activity book, I feel a need for something to be said. I don't know what needs to be said or who needs to say it, but without good wordsmiths and 
            good words, we find ourselves in a world lacking the depth of understanding needed to effectively empathize and engage.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I write, I want you to know that my words come from a warm place, but they are tasked with an almost impossible job: to convey and fully encapsulate a language that 
            cannot be translated one-to-one. Your misunderstanding is certainly foremost my fault, as a writer can always make the choice to say more. However, I often find myself 
            realizing that more is less because the right words don't come from the depths of your skull alone, so much as they come from the natural world through your own lens. A 
            story is not solely found in you; rather, sometimes it is realized in the moments with the least color. I am limited by my experience. If I wait for an event to strike 
            me, I will have lived my entire life having written nothing. Instead, to discover a story I must take a deeper look at the things in my life that I fail to give the 
            proper attention. Story can be found anywhere. It is discovered in rent money, the tire treads, a broken guitar string, your next-door neighbor, and the ink we have yet 
            to use.

            My hope is that I am able to give you something that hugs you with just 5% of the strength it hugs me. The only thing I ask of my readers is that you attempt to "get it." 
            To fill in the blanks that I am unable to, because nothing is perfect, and it never will be. I think I'm trying to say something.

            Alright, my oil change is done. Rock on, man. I need a nap.

            Hey! I hope you're doing okay. I just wanted to let you know that I'm glad you're here, right now. Have a glass of water if you haven't in a while. Tell someone you 
            appreciate all they do for you. I think it's really cool that we can use the internet in this way to reach people and ideas far beyond the file that contains this text. 
            We're pretty damn lucky to experience right now. Basically what I'm saying is, in a way, we're hanging out right now. So, thanks for kicking it.
