        <h2>your attention is not necessary</h2>
        <h3>may 26, 2024 - 11:02 pm</h3>

        <p>
            Okay, I’ve been trying to write this for like four months now. I just haven’t been able to get myself to sit down and let the thoughts flow, but if you’re reading this, 
            it means I learned something and I want to share that with you.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I was younger I was always told things like, “You’re so mature for your age,” and “You’re such a smart kid.” I think I was told those things not because other people knew 
            they were true, but rather because I grew up around a lot of people who thought that’s what they should say. Maybe they wanted to encourage me to keep trying, keep digging, 
            keep doing things that I liked. Maybe they only said that because that’s what they had been told by someone else to say in this kind of a situation. Or maybe that’s just what 
            you say. Either way, it did make me feel particularly mature and smart. At least until life threw a bulldozer at me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m not going to explain what that bulldozer is. Firstly, because you could be a random person on the internet and I have zero interest in you knowing much of anything about me. 
            Secondly, if you happen to be one of the people that knows me then you might already know what I’m talking about (or if you chose to use your brain for once in your god damned 
            life you might be able to figure it out). Lastly, I don’t really think that context matters because everyone has bulldozers in their life and, well, I’m just going to assume 
            you get it.
        </p>

        <p>
            So anyway, I come out the other side of the bulldozer looking like Flat Stanley (a hollow, empty husk of a human being), and my own understanding of my sense of self and who I 
            am begins to slowly crumble from the bottom up. I start asking questions. What do I want to do with my life? Where am I in my life? Am I hungry enough to start thinking about 
            making dinner? Who am I? That kind of thing. I think that’s pretty normal as far as human experience goes.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the main things I realize during this time is that I am not being true to myself. The line between who I actually am and the “performance” that I show to other people 
            has been blurred to extreme proportions. For a long time I don’t think I could have told you the difference, or even pointed out that there was a difference. I’m not really 
            even sure how my brain arrived at this train of thought to begin with (it probably has something to do with the bulldozer). What I can tell you, is that it made me feel strange 
            and lost. It made me paranoid and anxious. Kind of like in a video game where you go to the fucked up dark world where everything looks similar but is fifteen percent off from 
            what you remember it being.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve always known that I liked experiencing things. I like watching movies, I like listening to music, I like playing games; it just feels right in my bones. Just recently however, 
            I’ve realized that I really truly enjoy making things. I like writing code for some nerdy project, I like writing songs on my guitar, I liked making those ugly ass clay bowls in 
            art class to give to my Mom. But back then I don’t think I would have done any of that had someone not forced me to. I was a kid. I did things strictly because I had orders to 
            do them and not simply because I wanted to do them for myself or because they felt “right.” That strange, anxious feeling that inhabited my brain for so long seemed to disappear 
            when people told me to do things. Now I know that that feeling was only silenced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, as I enter my last year of college, I am faced with the reality that I have to pay rent, and eat, and make something of myself, or whatever that means. That paranoia 
            and disconnection that I got hints of when I was younger, started to speak really loudly a couple years ago. For the first time in my life I have to figure out what I want out 
            of this great big world. Those people that encouraged me to make things early on are no longer an ever-present force in my everyday life. If I was going to continue to do the 
            things I love, I needed a reason to do them. I wanted other people to want me to make things.
        </p>

        <p>
            My sense of self was based on the things that I made, the value I provided to the world. My reason for making things was based upon other people’s abilities to perceive them. 
            And I, as any good coked-out writer would do, tried to give my perceived audience what I thought they wanted. I couldn’t put myself into my work because (and this goes back to 
            the bulldozer) I was afraid of showing my actual self to anyone. From my perspective, I am a deeply weird, lost, anxious, outcast who is too gross to ever be understood from the 
            inside out. Just as much as I did not want to talk about who I thought I was, I had no intention of ever showing my unkempt underbelly to the rest of the world, in fear of what 
            they might think. Instead I adopted a mask, a personality separate from myself, a dope ass matte black custom wrap for the shitty Toyota Corolla that is me.

            I know I’m stupid for thinking this way. I can literally see foam dripping out of your mouth while you’re reading this. You’re probably shouting at your screen, “Just be yourself, 
            pussy! Who cares!” And you would be one-hundred percent correct. There has never been a single reason in my entire life to lie about who I am, but at the time I didn’t even realize 
            I was lying to begin with. I lied because I wasn’t sure I, as myself, would be accepted for whatever I was. I lied because at first it was easier. I slept better knowing people 
            perceived me and my work as something I knew they would respect. What I didn’t know then is that every lie is a double-edged sword. Each lie compounds on the effects of the last 
            which created a real physical weight that I had to carry with me, each and every day of my life for the past twenty years.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>I’m done carrying that weight.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t care what you think about me. I don’t care what you think about the things that I’ve done. All I want is to make things that are authentically me. That’s really it. 
            Everything I do, I want to be able to give the Jackson stamp of fuck you. I am who I am. To me, if I am not ashamed of something I’ve done then I have not truly done it. 
            Ultimately, the value of the things I do is determined solely by my own ability to appreciate why I did it in the first place. I want to feel ashamed for having committed myself 
            completely to something that I really truly believe is worth while. If I can’t feel ashamed, I haven’t stayed true to me. I want to feel each and every ounce of myself to its 
            fullest extent. Everything is embarrassing to me and everything makes me nervous. Why would I share something if it’s not embarrassing? Why would I try something new if it doesn’t 
            make me the slightest bit nervous? I don’t know, I think I’m allowed to feel that way. Or maybe that’s just another lie.
        </p>

        <p>
            The truth is I am deathly afraid of what other people think. I’ve led my whole life up to this point trying to be what I think you want me to be. The truth is that I really do 
            believe in the value of my work, my art, whatever you want to call it, but none of it means anything if no one sees it. If no one cares. If no one relates or connects in some way. 
            The truth is most of the time, I feel alone. I feel lost. I desperately want to show you the parts of myself and the parts of my world that I think are beautiful. But to do that, 
            I first have to open up my core self to you. I can’t care about what you think, because if I do, I’ll stop myself from doing anything at all. I’ll end up back behind the 
            metaphorical wall that Pink Floyd made all those songs about.
        </p>

            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been trying to be truthful to you, dear reader, and I’d like to think I’m doing a good job but I can’t really be sure. I’m just trying to help myself understand why I’m 
            like this. And also to light a fire under my ass, and hopefully that’ll get me moving in the right direction.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you organically fuck with me or whatever I do, that’s awesome. I’m glad I was able to connect with you in that way, but I’m not entirely sure I can prioritize your experience 
            over mine anymore. There will always be an inherent connection between the things I make and the people who choose to experience them. However, like most things in life, a 
            delicate balance is necessary to maintaining sanity. Specifically, a balance between how I feel and how you feel. And I think I’ve been ignoring my end of the see-saw for quite 
            a while now. I’m not sure what that perfect balance looks like for me or anybody else, or if one even exists. All I know is that the more I do, the more I discover about myself. 
            I need to be me. I really really need to be me. It’s the only thing that’s worked so far. I’m not sure I will ever “find myself” or change anybody’s life for the better. But in 
            my pursuit of trying to be myself, if at any point I or anybody else can look back at something I’ve done and say, “Hey I think this is sick,” then it would all be worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Before you go, I just wanted to say that I think you’re amazing. You are worth it. You are important. You are interesting. You are beautiful. You should give yourself a break 
            from time to time. Go eat a good meal. Go give someone a hug. Life is a beautiful thing and I am so happy that I get to enjoy it with you.
