        <p>
            For the first time in a long time, I sat down on the grass. It felt wrong. Something about it made me feel like I was breaking a kind of unspoken rule. 
            If a person would have walked by me in that moment I would have felt a bit ashamed of what I was doing. There was a certain crispness in the air that afternoon. 
            The kind that makes your hair feel half as heavy when it’s blowing in the wind. The kind that makes you really appreciate a nice jacket. I take my hands out of my pockets 
            and put them around my waist. A deep breath is almost second nature. My phone gently reminds me that I have somewhere to be in fifteen minutes. 
            Yet somehow, for just that moment, father time was indifferent. I wish I could do this everyday.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, it’s been very difficult for me to get out of bed. It’s probably the lamest problem of all time. Like, literally just get up. The alarm has gone off and I’ve got 
            things to do, it should be that simple. But there’s this barrier that I keep running face first into. This overwhelming gray. It covers every part of my body and clogs my pores, 
            making it impossible for the rest of the world to hear my soul scream. Is this how I am supposed to feel? Or is this how it has always felt and I’m just no longer numb to it? 
            Sometimes I feel like it’s both.
        </p>

        <p>
            On one hand, we live in a world that desperately wishes to get rid of us. I am an added weight that keeps the Earth from spinning slightly faster than it would otherwise be able 
            to. Whether it’s a long line at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles on a Friday morning or your reusable bag falling apart as you step outside the grocery store, life seems to always 
            throw you a middle finger at every opportunity it gets. If you want to survive you have to fight back. You have to fight for yourself, because no one else will ever give a shit. 
            Every day feels like a battle because it is one. Man versus nature. You against The Man. Man against the self.
        </p>

        <p>
            Or maybe it’s just me. It’s easy enough to pass judgment and anger onto people you’re envious of. I’m all too guilty of that. It’s easy to say that my hard work didn’t lead to a 
            job offer because I was set up by this thing or this person just doesn’t have the empathy required to understand me or whatever thing was most recently frustrating me. Let’s be 
            real though; I’m a worthless hunk of scrap. On the days I am unable to brush my teeth in the morning, I’m no more valuable than a faulty gas pedal. It is my responsibility alone 
            that I am happy with what happens to me. When I fail to make breakfast, that’s my fault. When I fail to get to an appointment on time, that’s my fault. When I fail to uphold the 
            relationships that matter to me, that’s my fault. I let the gray win because in my head the battle was already over before it began. The same thing happened yesterday and it will 
            happen again tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            There comes a point where you just have to get up though. Just like resetting a breaker box after a rough thunderstorm, every switch is flipped at once and the ability to control 
            my limbs returns just long enough to get me up and out of my room. Often times it’s late enough to the point where I’ve missed my first class of the day. I keep telling myself 
            that next time I’m just gonna wake up earlier. I just won’t go to bed as late. I’ll just stop having a lot of sugar past dinner time. None of that stuff usually works. It’s all 
            just an attempt to keep me going even though my tank has been on empty for an amount of time that’s not possible to fully comprehend.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Despite how much effort it takes to get myself to move forward even an inch, not moving at all is somehow more terrifying. The older I get, the faster and faster my head has to 
            spin to feel like I’m even remotely keeping up. There are so many events and news stories to keep track of. There are even more people that quickly enter and exit my life that 
            it’s difficult to remember why they even mattered to me in the first place. Not to mention I feel like I gain a new understanding for the full gravity of each of my 
            responsibilities every day. To let the tsunami of worries crash into me at full force appears to be a reasonable option after weighing all the pros and cons. But we can’t let 
            that come to fruition.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m not sure where it comes from, but there’s a will to keep fighting. There’s this strong enough idea. Maybe it’s called “hope” or “stubbornness,” I’m not really sure. 
            Regardless, this will keeps me going. In my absence, it makes the conscious choice that I will cross off a couple tasks from my notes app everyday. I will do the bear minimum 
            it takes to get through this. There is a war in the world. The war needs soldiers. You are a soldier. That is all you need to know. Do not ask questions and you will avoid 
            suffering in the now. You are not allowed to slow down. There is no reason to do so. However, just as there is a will to keep going, there is a will to ask questions—there is a 
            will to understand.
        </p>

        <p>
            What honor is there in fighting a battle that has no end goal? Why is my enemy the shadow of an idea? What costs remain unpaid because of my own brash decision to pursue 
            momentary self interest? What pastures of the future do I expect to exist when I needlessly drop warheads on the empty expanse of the present? Do I actually care about any of 
            this? Or have I fallen into my own trap again?
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, I made the choice to care. Coming to a complete stop is painful, but letting your head be pushed down such that your eyes avoid the truth, hurts a little more. 
            I’m not really even sure what taking my time looks like. I guess this is my attempt at it.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve never really felt like I belonged. Not in an “I’m different than all the other girls” kind of way, but in an “I fundamentally don’t understand what I’m doing here” kind 
            of way. Sometimes I feel like a ghost that occasionally floats by someone else’s existence. Silently wishing that I understood what they did, what they knew about being alive. 
            In hopes that I could somehow conjure a meaningful purpose that brings me back to a plain that includes being. Maybe that’s a bit too emo. Okay, start over.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I’ve never really felt like I belonged. There’s something that other people seem to know about living that I don’t. Every interaction I have with someone has me second guessing 
            whether I talk like a normal human being or an alien who’s trying to blend in. Was it weird when I shook their hand or was that a normal thing to do? Do they notice how much I’m 
            shaking right now or am I building this up in my head? Should I mention it? I don’t know. It just seems that other people are happier to be where I am than I am. If they’re happy 
            then I should be too, right? Hold on, I think I’m lost again. Okay, deep breaths. Start over.
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s something that other people seem to know about living that I don’t. My friends always seem to have some idea as to where they’re going or where they came from, whereas I’m 
            perpetually stuck in a never ending hypothetical. The thing is though, no one has it together entirely. I’m just not able to perceive that because they choose not to communicate 
            that to me. Everyone has their own struggles. Everyone is allowed to struggle. That’s okay. What’s beautiful about friendships is that you can be there for each other. You don’t 
            have to go through this alone. You can be lost together. The only caveat is you have to take the time to understand your unique situation. You have to find the words that complete 
            your own picture. You are the only one who can do that heavy lifting. Fuck. That hurts. Hold on, slow down for a second. Fuck. I lost my thought. Hold on, start over.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do my friends even care about me? What are you saying, of course they do. Why else would they be by your side when you ask them to? How can I know that? You can’t but you can be 
            confident. Is confidence good enough in a world that is increasingly uncertain? Confidence and courage is all I can ever hope to have. It has to be enough. Do you think you’re 
            courageous? No, but I think that’s changing. Do you know its changing or are you just confident that it’s changing? Wait, hold on, I think I’m going faster, not slowing down. I 
            think I’m lost again.
        </p>

        <p>
            You like being lost. I think you’re right. Feeling lost is like a warm blanket to me. Why does uncertainty feel more like being at home than understanding myself? Being uncertain 
            and afraid is okay. There doesn’t have to be an answer to every question. The unfamiliar is ultimately familiar because it is known that there is a feeling that is unfamiliar. 
            You will always know that you are unable to know. To find comfort in that knowledge isn’t cowardly, it’s the bravest thing you can do. You think I’m afraid? Of course you’re 
            afraid. You’re afraid that you’ll never find solace. You’re afraid that you’ll never connect with someone that feels like you do. You’re afraid you’ll never be accepted. You’re 
            afraid you’ll never be the person your parents want you to be. You’re afraid of letting them know. You’re afraid of falling short of the already pathetically low expectations you 
            give to yourself and guess what? You will always fail. You will always be held back by yourself. You will never find a magic quote or song that solves your problems. The roadblock 
            you experience is not just where you are right now—the roadblock is the entire road. You are not able to live with yourself if you continue to shove this down and run away. You 
            will never be what I want you to be because I don’t exist and neither does he.
        </p>

        <p>
            What do you do when you're afraid?
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>You cry.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you see it? It’s so clear to me now that it has been pointed out. The question that I should be asking is, am I one or two? If I am unable to live with myself, that implies 
            that there is the “I” that my “self” cannot live with. Maybe only one of them is real.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m tired of this game of cat and mouse. I’m just done. My energy is consistently spent in time other than right now, which is where it should be spent. The Now is a very 
            difficult thing to grasp onto. It is constantly moving and changing. Ever-evolving into a form that is increasingly difficult to catch if you chase it. The thing is, while 
            the present is able to be caught, the past and the future are not. There is no use perusing them because they do not hold the keys to open the door directly in front of you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Is this the answer I’ve settled on? I cannot be sure that I’ve solved my or anyone else’s issues, but for right now, yeah. I wouldn’t really call it an answer though. It’s more 
            of a mode-of-transport. A way of understanding. An opportunity to consider what is. It gives me a new place to begin. It gives me a way to live deliberately, right now. I think 
            about whether I’m slowing down or speeding up. I think about where “I” am. What I can do. I think about whether its possible that writing these words have dug me deeper down a 
            hole that I cannot imagine the full extent of. I often wonder about the stars. Sometimes I wonder if they look down on me. I wonder if they’re proud. Of me. Of us.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had laid down yesterday and I got up today. I will lay down tonight and I will get up tomorrow. I think that’s something to be proud of.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Before you go, I just wanted to say that I appreciate you for having read all of this. Sometimes I worry that I ramble too much or my thoughts make no sense, but if you’re here 
            that means you found what I had to say to be at least mildly interesting. Or at least more interesting than anything else you have immediate access to on the internet. Or you 
            skipped to the end. Regardless of what category you fall into, I think you’re awesome. I really do. Living is hard, but you’ve persevered! It’s important to acknowledge all the 
            work you’ve done, and to reward yourself with a break every now and then. Go tell someone you love them. Kick back with a good movie or a video game. You deserve it! Thank you 
            for letting me talk. I’ll see you soon.
        </p>
